 Sample Landing Page
=====================

Your task is pretty simple, just build up a Landing Page based on the layout provided below:
https://www.figma.com/file/kQrVAWt51iIwqI441iaiS9/Heller_Event_LP?node-id=0%3A1.
You can create an account on figma ( it's free ) and get all the information you need for that sample Landing Page.

__Requirements__:

* You should add to this project 4 files, a PHP page, an HTML page, a CSS and JS files.
* The layout only contains the Desktop layout, but we requires you to make it mobile friendly.
* The layout has a form, we need you to add the empty validation for all fields, and once it is filled out, submit to the fields.php page
* On the fields.php page you only need to get the fields value and print on the page output.

__Source Code Details__:

* Please add a txt file called development.txt explaining the decisions you took on this project.
* Feel free to use any JS framework if you want, just explain why did you use it on the development.txt file.
* Please fork the project, add your source code there and add a "Pull request" to the repository
* Using responsive layout and build system is a plus ;-)
